name: kubelet
description: |
  An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that
  containers are running in a pod.

  The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various
  mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are
  running and healthy. The kubelet doesnâ€™t manage containers which were not
  created by Kubernetes.

  kubelet.flags:
    description: |
      A list of additional flags to pass to the kubelet daemon.  These flags are
      appended to the command-line after the hard-coded default flags.  Use this option
      with caution; it has the possibility to horribly break your deployment.

      Each item in the list should have a single key (the flag, minus the trailing `--`)
      whose value will be used as the flag value.
    default: []
